# A Deep Learning Framework for Dynamic Investor Views in the Black-Litterman Model

This repository contains a comprehensive portfolio optimization pipeline that integrates the **Black-Litterman model** with **machine learning-based investor views**, using CNN-BiLSTM networks and Monte Carlo Dropout to model return expectations and uncertainty.

## Project Highlights

- **Black-Litterman Optimization**: Market-consistent asset allocation framework with dynamic risk aversion.
- **Machine Learning Views**: Forecasting expected returns and confidence using CNN-BiLSTM models.
- **Monte Carlo Dropout**: Uncertainty estimation for model confidence via Bayesian deep learning approximation.
- **Backtesting Framework**: Full training and out-of-sample (bi-weekly rebalanced) evaluations.
- **Benchmarking**: Compared against NIFTY 50 Index with visualizations and excess return computation.

## How It Works

### 1. Fetch Data

Retrieves historical daily prices and market caps for NIFTY 50 constituents via Yahoo Finance.

### 2. Feature Engineering

Computes technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD, volatility, etc.) to enhance signal quality.

### 3. Train CNN-BiLSTM Models

Each stock has its own deep learning model trained on a sliding window of historical data to predict cumulative 5-day returns.

### 4. Generate Views

Expected returns and uncertainties are extracted using **Monte Carlo dropout** inference.

### 5. Black-Litterman Integration

Combines implied equilibrium returns with model-driven views via:

- `œÑ`: view uncertainty scalar
- `Œª`: dynamic risk aversion estimated from market conditions

### 6. Portfolio Optimization

Allocates capital across assets using mean-variance optimization adjusted for view-integrated expected returns.

### 7. Backtesting

The backtesting process is designed to be efficient by separating model training from strategy evaluation. It involves two main steps to avoid unnecessary re-running of TensorFlow models within the backtesting loop:

1.  **Pre-computation of Views**: CNN-BiLSTM models are trained once on historical data to generate expected returns and uncertainties (views). These views are then saved.
2.  **Strategy Simulation**: The Black-Litterman optimization and portfolio allocation are performed using the pre-computed views in a bi-weekly rebalanced out-of-sample simulation.

## Notes on ML Views

Each model:

- Uses 19 technical features
- Employs Gaussian noise, dropout, and batch normalization
- Is trained individually per stock with early stopping
- Outputs **expected 5-day return** + **uncertainty** via standard deviation over 50 MC dropout samples

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Annualized Return**
- **Volatility**
- **Sharpe Ratio**
- **Max Drawdown**
- **Excess Return over NIFTY 50**

## Credits

Developed for academic and quant research purposes. Inspired by the integration of subjective ML views into probabilistic portfolio construction frameworks.
